<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/maseiler/swms-monitoring)

This is a repository for the university project "Master Project: Distributed Systems - Monitoring of Scientific Workflows" attended during the summer term 2022 at the Technical University Berlin. In this project we should gain practical experience with so called Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWMS) and extend existing ones with additional functionalities to give them extra value. In our subproject we extend the SWMS Apache Airflow monitoring capabilities with the following capabilities:

* coming soon

The project should use a semi realistic environment and is therefore settled in the [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/de/) ecosystem to reflect the actual real world scenarios with huge workloads in highly distributed systems.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

We try to make the deployment as simple as possible and therefore using kubernetes and helm to deploy a working prototype to the Google Cloud Plattform.

To get a copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
- Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- Install and configure [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)

### Deploy

Simply run `./setup.sh` in the cloned repository directory.


### Deprovision
> IMPORTANT: Always shut down all instances when you are done working!
> 
Run `./deprovision.sh` to prune all artificats and confirm with `y`.
